              Beside the bank of mighty Padma, our alma mater "Rajshahi Cadet College" stands and proves her existence.
              Since the inception, our alma matter has been the maker of the future leaders who are spread out in every corner
              of the world. From the beginning she has been a silent obeserver of the individuals who entered and passed out through
              her gates, the individuals who are spread across the world and shining like stars. So, here is a small effort from all of us
              so that none of those brilliant existences gets lost within the span of time. We hope all our predecessors, ourselves and our
              successors will be remembered throughout the ages and let all of us prosper together.
